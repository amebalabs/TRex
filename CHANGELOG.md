# v2.0.1-beta.1 (2026-07-12)

# TRex v2.0.1 Beta 1 Release Notes

This beta focuses on update reliability, OCR correctness, and safer handling of captured content.

## Improvements

- Production releases are now also published to the beta update feed, so users on the beta train continue receiving the newest eligible build.
- OCR engine routing, automatic language detection, custom words, and fallback behavior are more consistent across Vision, Tesseract, and LLM providers.
- LLM requests now use fresh sessions for each capture, validate custom endpoints, enforce image-size limits, and support Apple Foundation Models on macOS 26.
- Table output handles uneven rows, escaped Markdown, and embedded line breaks in CSV and TSV more reliably.
- App Store builds now normalize embedded frameworks and exclude unavailable third-party LLM controls and initialization.
- Onboarding, settings, capture history, menu behavior, accessibility labels, and drag-and-drop feedback have been refined for macOS.

## Fixes

- Fixed Unicode text before a URL causing incorrect URL detection ranges.
- Fixed empty Vision results clearing the clipboard or capture history.
- Fixed OCR timeouts waiting indefinitely for operations that ignored cancellation.
- Fixed concurrent Tesseract requests racing through the shared engine.
- Fixed watch mode repeatedly processing blank captures and accepting unsafe output paths.
- Fixed temporary-file collisions and incomplete cleanup in the CLI, Shortcuts, and CLI installer.
- Fixed the CLI installer accepting invalid downloads and preserving stale executable permissions.
- Fixed release signing and notarization cleanup paths that could leave sensitive temporary files behind.
- Fixed screen-coordinate conversion on displays with different scale factors.

## Testing

- Added regression coverage for OCR engine replacement, Unicode URL detection, watch-mode paths, table formatting, timeouts, LLM session isolation, endpoint validation, and image preprocessing.

- **Fixed engine selection**: Corrected issue where Tesseract engine was being selected even when disabled in preferences, causing fallback to incorrect engines with poor results
- **Language identifier handling**: Improved `LanguageCodeMapper.standardize()` to properly handle locale-based language codes

### Image Preprocessing
- **Enhanced text recognition accuracy**: Added automatic image preprocessing with:
  - +30% contrast enhancement
  - +10% brightness adjustment
  - +10% saturation boost
