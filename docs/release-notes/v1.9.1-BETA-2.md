# TRex v1.9.1-BETA-2 Release Notes

## 🛠 Fixes

- **Release pipeline reliability**: Resolved GitHub Actions caching conflicts by moving the CLI binary into an isolated build cache directory, preventing restore failures when staging artifacts for signing and notarization.
- **Notarization flow guardrails**: Ensured the CLI binary stays signed/notarized in-place, simplifying the notarization submission and reducing chances of entitlement-related errors during packaging.

## 🔧 Improvements

- **CI transparency**: Added targeted logging around staging the CLI artifact during signing and release so troubleshooting future release runs is faster.

## ✅ Deployment Notes

- This build is intended to exercise the full release pipeline end-to-end. Tag the repository with `v1.9.1-BETA-2` to trigger the release workflow once you are ready.
