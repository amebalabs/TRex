# TRex v1.9.1 Release Notes

## ✨ New Features

### Command Line Tool
- **In-app CLI installer**: Added one-click installation of the TRex command-line tool directly from the app's preferences window
- **User-local installation**: Installs to `~/.local/bin/trex` with no admin privileges required

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Language Recognition
- **Fixed language code normalization**: Resolved issues with Czech (and potentially other) language recognition where language codes with underscores (`cs_CZ`) weren't being properly converted to the hyphen format (`cs-CZ`) required by Apple Vision OCR
- **Fixed engine selection**: Corrected issue where Tesseract engine was being selected even when disabled in preferences, causing fallback to incorrect engines with poor results
- **Language identifier handling**: Improved `LanguageCodeMapper.standardize()` to properly handle locale-based language codes

### Image Preprocessing
- **Enhanced text recognition accuracy**: Added automatic image preprocessing with:
  - +30% contrast enhancement
  - +10% brightness adjustment
  - +10% saturation boost
- These improvements help recognize low-contrast and light-colored text more reliably
